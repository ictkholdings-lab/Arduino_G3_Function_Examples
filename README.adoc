Arduino_G3_Function_Examples

This library provides for efficient use of G3 using I2C, and understands G3 through some examples. 

Step. 1
To do some examples, you need to include the file from the link "https://github.com/ictkholdings-lab/Arduino_G3_Function_Examples.git" in your sketch library.

Step. 2
To use G3, you need to change the buffer size of I2C. You need to change #define TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH 32 in twi.h of "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\libraries\Wire\src\utility" to 140. Also, in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\libraries\Wire\src"
#define BUFFER_LENGTH 32 should be changed to 140.
